# Compact Messenger Theme
The main purpose of this project is to reduce every margin, padding, reduce rounded corners and compact Messenger to make use of any space that could be potentially be wasted with modern "bubble" themes or Material Design system.

While doing this I also want to bring old blogs/xat eras without changing too much modern design. (Squared icons, all messages on the same side, remove seen icons, etc.)

## For the future
At the moment there's everything said above but without a configuration popup, this might be implemented in the future if there is people interested in this project as I did this mostly for my personal use.
